# hsp60ECCtool
This script allows to get Enterobacter cloacae complex hsp60 cluster from a multi-Fasta file.

# Dependencies
Perl programming language and [NCBI-Blast+](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/) are needed to run the proram.
If you are using Linux Ubuntu/Debian, you can use the following command to install NCBI-Baslt+:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ncbi-blast+
```

# Description
hsp60ECCtool is a program dedicated to Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) that detects and identifies the partial coding sequence of hps60. It is based on the BLASTn algorithm and a specific dataset (based on sorted hsp60 sequences collected from GenBank ECC assemblies). The program helps users to clearly identify the hsp60 cluster and associated members of the Enterobacter cloacae complex.

- The tested strain(s) must be identified as belonging to the complex by a traditional method (API 20E, mass spectrometry...) before hsp60 typing.
- Partial amplification of the gene coding for hsp60 should be performed according to the initiale approach proposed by Hoffmann H. and Roggenkamp A. (2003).
- Hsp60 cluster assignment was done according to the original research article and additional analysis provided by Berouthy R. et al. (2018) and Pot M. et al. (2021).
- Associated species names are given according to Sutton GG. et al. (2018) and Wu W. et al. (2020).
- Best results are given in the hsp60ECCtool Result output. UD : Undefined Cluster (see in Figure S1 in the supplementary material provided by Pot M. et al. (2020)); NA : - Not Attributed in the related research paper. Without whole-genome sequencing and additional analyses, the precise species identification remains indicative and should be taken with caution.
